Instructions for Testing Tools:
-------------------------------

The Installation Manual has details regarding the software I used to test the multiRunTester for my demo. 
Simply follow the instructions and keep track of which batch you are uploading when checking the values.

There are two batches, Test1 and Test2. The values for both audits are in TestData.xlsx, and I used them to
check that my code works correctly. 

The node_modules folder contains the PubNub API, and as such it is NECESSARY to zip it with any code that 
uses the PubNub API when uploaded to AWS S3. 

Happy Testing!!!
